{"name":"Ardown","tagline":"Toy Markdown implementation in Ruby.","body":"# Ardown\r\n\r\nArdown is a very simple implementation of [Markdown][]. It supports minimal\r\nsyntax and formatting, but it works for documents I write. Due to its minimal\r\nfunctionality, it is also quite fast.\r\n\r\nArdown is a hobby project and should probably not be used in production\r\nenvironments.\r\n\r\n[Markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'ardown'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install ardown\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe gem contains an executable so you can use it from the command line:\r\n\r\n    $ ardown path/to/document.md > document.html\r\n\r\nIn your Ruby project, you can create a new `Document` and convert it to HTML:\r\n\r\n    require 'ardown'\r\n    Ardown::Document.new('## Heading 2').to_html # => \"<h2>Heading 2</h2>\\n\"\r\n\r\nSince Ardown parses Markdown into an AST that is then rendered as HTML, it\r\nshould be trivial to extend it to support other output formats.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it (https://github.com/avdgaag/ardown/fork)\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create a new Pull Request\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nCreated by: Arjan van der Gaag  \r\nURL: [http://arjanvandergaag.nl](http://arjanvandergaag.nl)  \r\nProject homepage: [http://avdgaag.github.com/ardown](http://avdgaag.github.com/ardown)  \r\nDate: July 2014\r\nLicense: [MIT-license](https://github.com/avdgaag/ardown/LICENSE.txt) (same as Ruby)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
